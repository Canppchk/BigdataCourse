    "### Running the App\n",
    "The app is very similar to what we have worked in the previous set of notebooks. In fact, it uses the same set of ports, so please click the circle <img src=images/kernel.png width=15px/> to the left to make sure the kernels for the previous notebooks have been stopped. Press the ↻ above to restart the kernel for this notebook.\n",

Unlike before, this dashboard runs continuously, so press the ■ above to stop it in order to make changes. Because of this, make sure to build the link to the dashboard before launching the dashboard itself.\n",

    "### Changing the Code\n",

    " * *I think I should update `lines 24 - 25`, and I'll need to add `compute()` somewhere...*\n",
    "* *The `to_pandas()` on `line 58` seems to be in a bad spot.*\n",
    " * *Should I delete it and add a `to_pandas()` line in `update_map` and `update_series`?*\n",
    "* *Right now, `update_series` produces a line for all loaded stations, but I want to make it show only one station.*\n",
    " * *I should update `line 218` and delete `line 219`.*\n",
    "* *I should make a test for data quality. Maybe I should add a `print(df.describe())` somewhere.*\n",
    " * *If something is wrong, bet I can fix it by adding one line.*\n",
    " \n",
    "*If I implement the above, I believe I can get each method to run under one second!*\n",
